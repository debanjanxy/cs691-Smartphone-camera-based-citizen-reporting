Every year more than 1.25 million people die as a result of road traffic accidents \cite{b2}. And the major cause of these road traffic accidents is traffic rules violation. In this project, we propose a solution by which any responsible citizen can report traffic rules violation incidents without any difficulties. We have developed an application through which citizens can record traffic rules violation incidents and send it directly to the corresponding authority. When the citizen uploads the video to the authority's server, it gets processed automatically to detect traffic rules violation incidents without any human intervention. 
\par In this project our focus was on identifying riders not wearing a helmet. However,building such a system needs a huge amount of visual (image/video) data of traffic rules violation incidents and Indian number plates to build a predictive model. 

\par We have experimented with different types of machine learning techniques to extract features from the images and then applied several classification models on those features. These classification models filter out only those images where the bike rider is not wearing the helmet. Now, these images are provided to a number plate detection module which will detect the number plate of the vehicle. We have achieved 75.7\% accuracy in helmet detection task and 75\% accuracy in number plate detection task.
