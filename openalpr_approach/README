Localize the number plate:
	First know the problem very well. Like what is the problem. From what domain the problem is coming. And how others had solved it previously. 
	Read from wikipedia. Then read 2 or 3 research papers and then just note down the the ideas that you think is worth looking into for. 
		
		Identify the set of color and fonts in the plate images of our data set. And how 
 
 		Attempt to identify a rectangular region of an image where the colors are predominantly white, black or yellow, black.

		Do some clean up on your subregion such conversion to pure black and white (monochrome) and perhaps scaling/shifting into a nice, tight rectangle.

		Next employ an existing OCR (optical character recognition) algorithm on your sub-selected image region so see if you can read the text.
